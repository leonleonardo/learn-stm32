# Learn STM32

This repo is a collection of various examples on the STM32F411CE Black Pill. 
I intend to create various projects that utilize the different 
peripherals included in the STM32F4. 


## Roadmap

- Blinky1 - The classic blinky program built using a software delay.

- Blinky2 - The classic blinky program built using a timer and an interrupt.

- Counter - External interrupt to count how many times a button is pressed. 

- Led Matrix Animation - Display an animation on an 8x8 led matrix.

- USB to SPI converter - Echo any serial input received by USB over SPI.

- Voltmeter - Use the ADC to read a differential voltage between two availiable pins and transmit the result back to host system over USB.
